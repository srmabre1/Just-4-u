  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <div class="story">
Hey my dear best frn, i know my English is not good so here I’m gonna use both English and Urdu words.

I don't know ki tum ko yaad hogah ya nhi, but meko yaad hai ki jab hum melay woh pehla din jab hum ne baat ki thi. But that was awesome… because if we didn’t meet that day, maybe right now I could be unable to write this 4 u.

Tum ko yaad hai ki how much time we have spent with each other? How much fun did we have with our frn circle?
Pata hai tum ko ki tayray pass khana bilkul nhi hota tha aur kaise tu humaray lunch box mein se khata tha…
Nope, I’m wrong — tu khata kaha tha? Tu toh TOOT padh ta tha. Just kidding 😜

And you know… when in our frn group everyone was absent but only u n me were coming in those days… and the special thing is that we both had only one lunch box.
Nope nope, I forgot to mention Asrar n Basit — jo lunch tou laatay thay but hum un may se nhi khatay thay. Hum woh lunch seedha sir ko de detay thay and main mana karta tha unka lunch khanay ko, aur pata hai, tu bhi phir nhi jata tha. (I know it sounds mad.)

And also I know that I can’t make this too much good but I’m trying, so plz accept it for me.

U know that day when we all decided that we will go home by taking a long path? Then I left my bus… but Huzaif n Uzair told us that they weren’t coming with us. But hum ne stop nhi kiya — hum uss din chalay gaye.

But pata hai main uss din chahta kya tha?
I was thinking… we both will go to Khurhama by walking. Yupp, my home.
And we had almost completed 95% of the path… but uss din tu wapis chala gaya.

Aur main chahta tha ki main tumko apnay ghar lejaao… but tu wapis gaya tha. Really yrr… that hurt me too much. Then I traveled the whole journey by myself.

Aur haan woh din yaad hai jab hum picnic gaye the? Aur tayri koi bhi pic achi nhi aa rahi thi? Yaad hai hmm.
And then we all got lost, and your phone was with me — that’s why we couldn’t even contact each other.

Is say yeh bhi yaad aaya ki jab tu apni mom ke liye ring le raha tha uss Hindu ke paas… Shayad tujhe hassi aa rahi hogi… yaad hai hmm?
Usne tayra haath pakda tha — yaad hai??
But kuch aur nhi hua, usne bas kaha:
“Dekho mera hath aur apna… kitna mulayam hai.” 😂😂
Just 4 fun.

And yupp, do u know that jab hum sab milay thay at Krusan…
Then Huzaif and Uzair had to cut their hair but U, I and my frn waited for them.
We all went to your home — remember?
Where we played Minecraft for a while and watched some memes.
Really bro, that was too much fun.

Aur tumko yaad hai woh class ka din jab tum bench pay kuch calisthenics kar rahe thay but tum gir gaye?
Phir pata hai main ne kya kiya?
Friendship ka first principle — FIRST LAUGH, THEN HELP.
Of course woh tum kaise bhool jaoge.

And now I didn’t want to make this too lengthy… but I can.
So I hope ki yeh chota sa birthday gift tumko pasand aaya.

I know ki yeh utna acha nhi hai, so plz accept it 4 me.

So yeah… this is my small birthday gift for you.

Happy Birthday, idiot.
I hope you liked it.
Thank you for being a part of my life.
