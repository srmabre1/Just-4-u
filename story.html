Hey my dear <span class='highlight'>best frn</span> i know my english is not good so hear im gonna use both English and urdu words ♥️<br><br>

I don't know ki tum ko yaadh hogah ya nhi but meko yaadh hai ki jb hum melay wou pehla din jb hum nay batt ki thi, but that was awesome cuz if we didn’t meet that day maybe right now I could b unable to write this 4 u. Tum ko yaadh hai ki how much tym we have spent with each other, how much fun did we without frn circle.<br><br>

Pata hai tum ko ki tay ray pass khana bilkul nhi hota tah aur kaisay tu hummaray lunch box may say khata tah, nope im wrong tu khata kaha tah tu tou toot padh ta tah 😜 just kidding.<br><br>

And u know when in our frn group everyone was absent but only u n me was coming in that days, n special thing is that we both was having only one lunch box. Nope nope i forgot to mention Asrar n Basit, jho lunch tou latai thay but hum unn may say nhi khatai tahy. Hum woh lunch seedhay sir ko dai tay thay and may mana kr ta tah unn ka lunch khanay ko aur pata hai tuu b frr nhi jata tah.<br><br>
(I know it's sound is like mad) and also i know that I can't make too much good this but im trying so plz accept it for me.

U know that day when we oll decided that we will go to home by taking long path, then i leave my bus but Huzaif n Uzair told us that thay aren't coming with us but hum nay stop nhi kiya hum uss din chalay gayai. But pata hai may uss din chata kya tah?

I was thinking we both will go to Khurhama by walking, yupp my home, and we had almost completed our 95% path but uss din tuu wapis chala gaya. Aur may chata tah ki may tum ko apnay gar lajawo but tuu wapis gaya tah — really yrr that hurt me too much, like then i traveled all journey by myself.

Aur haa woh din yaadh hai jb hum picnic gayai thay aur tay ree koi b pic aachi nhi aarhe thi yaadh hai hmm 😄. And then we oll got lost and ur phone was with mee that is why we could not even contact with each other. Iss say yeh b yaadh aaya ki jb tu apni mom kay liyai ring lay raha tah uss hindu kay pass — shayad tuko hassi aarahi ho gi 😆. Yaadh hai uss nay tay raa hath pakdah? But kuch aur nhi hova, uss nay bss kaha ki dekho may ra hath aur apna kitna mulayam hai 😂😂. Just 4 fun.<br><br>

And yupp do u know that when we all meet together at Krusan then Huzaif and Uzair have to cut their hair but U, I and my frn did wait for them. We all went to ur home, did u remember? Where we played Minecraft for a while n also watched some memes — really bro that was too much fun.

Aur tum ko yaadh hai woh class ka din jb tum bench pay kuch calisthenics kiya but tum gir gayai. Phir pata hai may nay kya kiya? Frn ship ka first principal — first laugh then help. Of course woh tum ko kabhi bhool jayai gah.

And now i didn't want to make it too lengthy but i can, so i hope ki yeh chotasa birthday gift tum ko passand aayai. I know ki yeh utna b aacha nhi hai so plz accept it 4 me.
So yeah… this is my small birthday gift for you 🎁<br>
<span class='highlight'>Happy Birthday idiot</span> 🎂😜<br>
Thank you for being a part of my life ❤️
